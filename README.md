# QSAR-quantitative-structure-activity-relationship

A curated collection of tutorials on QSAR (Quantitative Structure–Activity Relationship). By transforming chemical structures into numerical descriptors and applying statistical or machine learning models, QSAR enables the identification of key activity determinants, accelerates lead optimization, and supports the rational design of potent, selective compounds.
